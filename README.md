Hello,

I'm new to the community and currently in the learning phase. I've been working on a project that allows users to utilize server resources to convert their videos. Please note that this project is still a work in progress and is not yet completed.

To install the application, you can simply download the code and upload it to your PHP server. Ensure that FFmpeg is installed on your server for it to function properly.

Here's what's currently functional in the application:
1. Video upload functionality.
2. An upload progress bar to track the file upload progress.
3. The ability to select the output video format.
4. Conversion of uploaded videos to the desired output format.

However, there is a feature that is not working as intended, which is the FFmpeg conversion progress bar.

In the future, I plan to implement a feature for remote file uploads.

The project is named "Video-Php-FFMPEG-Converter."
